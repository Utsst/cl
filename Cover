Combining curiosity, creativity and technical skills, I've steered projects on editorial teams in the UK and Japan for over a decade.

At The Sunday Times in London, my computer science background helped me leapfrog into the team that produced the title’s first iPad app in 2010. Having worked closely with staff across the newsroom, I understood the priorities of each department and was able to convey their needs to the stakeholders, making it easier to secure buy-in among team members.

I joined DMG Media in 2012, managing a team of editors, designers and picture researchers for the production of the Daily Mail’s mobile app. The role also involved regular communication with developers and software partners to identify areas for improvement in the app and workflow.

Eager to learn about the media landscape in Japan, I moved to Tokyo in 2015, spending a year on an intensive Japanese language course before joining The Yomiuri Shimbun, where I’ve managed projects including the launch of an ePaper targeting international visitors to Japan.

I wear several hats in my current role, tackling everything from editing, translating and contributing content to working with other teams on initiatives to grow readership.

Offering fresh ideas and a strong desire to learn, I want to bring my production experience and passion for digital media to Apple’s APAC platform publishing team.
