Lyle Andrews
Recruiting Director, APAC
Apple
Dear Lyle Andrews:
Apple’s focus on user experience is one of the things that sets it apart from the competition, and this is reflected in the content published on Apple’s software platforms. Drawing on my experience overseeing editorial projects in the UK and Japan, I want to help the APAC platform publishing team deliver irresistible user-focused content across Apple media products.
Eager to learn about the media landscape in Japan, I moved to Tokyo in 2015, spending a year on an intensive Japanese language course before joining The Yomiuri Shimbun, where I’ve managed projects including the launch of an ePaper targeting international visitors.
I wear several hats in my current role, tackling everything from editing, translating and contributing content to working with other departments on digital initiatives. I’m comfortable discussing story ideas one minute, and offering feedback on website features the next.
In 2010, my computer science background helped me leapfrog into the iPad team at The Sunday Times, where I was a key conduit between technical staff and senior editors during the development of a new digital workflow.
I joined DMG Media in 2012 to manage the production of Daily Mail’s mobile app, steering a team of copy editors, designers and picture researchers. The role also involved regular communication with developers and software partners to troubleshoot issues with the app’s content management system and identify areas for improvement.
I believe in leading teams by example and always strive to raise the bar. As an AMP platform publisher manager, I’d like to help the APAC team become greater than the sum of its parts, bringing a generous dose of creativity and candor to the role.
Sincerely,
Atto Armoo"
