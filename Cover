Combining curiosity, creativity and technical skills, I have over a decade of experience steering editorial projects in the UK and Japan.

At The Sunday Times in London, my computer science background helped me leapfrog into the team that developed the title’s first iPad app in 2010. Having worked closely with members across the newsroom, I was able to communicate the priorities of each team to the key stakeholders.

I joined DMG Media in 2012, managing a team of editors, designers and picture researchers for the production of the Daily Mail’s mobile app. Working closely with developers and software partners based around the world, I analyzed metrics and feedback reports to identify areas for improvement.

Eager to learn about the media landscape in Japan, I moved to Tokyo in 2015, spending a year on an intensive Japanese language course before joining The Yomiuri Shimbun, where I’ve managed projects including the launch of an ePaper targeting international visitors to Japan.

I wear several hats in my current role, tackling everything from editing, translating and contributing content to working on projects with global partners to grow readership.

Offering fresh ideas and a strong desire to learn, I want to bring my production experience and passion for digital media to Apple’s APAC platform publishing team.
