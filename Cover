Lyle Andrews
Recruiting Director, APAC
Apple
Dear Lyle Andrews:
Combining curiosity, creativity and a generous dose of candor, I’ve steered projects on editorial teams in the UK and Japan for over a decade. WHY APPLE?
At The Sunday Times in London, my computer science background helped me leapfrog into the team that produced the title’s first iPad app in 2010. Having worked closely with staff across the newsroom, I understood the priorities of each department and was able to convey their needs to relevant stakeholders, making it easier to secure buy-in when the new workflow was rolled out.
I joined DMG Media in 2012 to manage the production of Daily Mail’s mobile app, leading a team of editors, designers and picture researchers. The role involved regular communication with developers and software partners to troubleshoot issues and identify areas for improvement.
Eager to learn about the media landscape in Japan, I moved to Tokyo in 2015, spending a year on an intensive Japanese language course before joining The Yomiuri Shimbun, where I’ve managed projects including the launch of an ePaper targeting international visitors.
I wear several hats in my current role, tackling everything from editing, translating and contributing content to working with other departments on initiatives to grow readership.
Offering fresh ideas and technical knowledge, I want to bring my production experience and passion for digital media to Apple’s APAC platform publishing team.
Sincerely,
Atto Armoo
